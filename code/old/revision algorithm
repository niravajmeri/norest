Desired state: ((emergency & !patient_consent) & records)

Counter-example: property is false
[0] -> State X.1 <-
[1]  emergency = FALSE
[OK] patient_consent = FALSE
[2]  records = FALSE

------------------------------------

[0] gets stuck at initial state, means you need new transition rules

[1] check transition rule: has random transition, does not depend on related variables [OK]

[2] check transition rule: records depends on consent, consent depends on patient_consent

- add new transition rule (records) [OK]

- add new transition rule (consent) [OK]

- add new transition rule (patient_consent) [NO] has to be false

- alternatives to add:

(i)  emergency, emergency_consent (available variables)
(ii) a1, c1 (norms with consequents that lead to desired property)
